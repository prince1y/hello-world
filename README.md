# hello-world
My first Github repository. The beginning of a great journey.
My name is Enobakhare Princely, a newbie programmer with strong interest in building out of nothing. Currently learning vanilla javascript(ES6), having learnt html and css.
As at the time of writing, I'd taken a course or two on database and sql. And know one or two things about SDLC.
